# Arma 3 Realistic Operations Template - Altis

## Description
A template to generate your own Ace3 missions using MCC or create your own missions on the fly with Zeus. The template has a pre-configured base set up for your squad. Furthermore the Ace3 settings have a default 'Milsim Lite' configuration but the parameter screen allows users to customize a lot of settings.

## How to
Login to MCC by opening the MCC console (ctrl + delete). Next check the mission settings by clicking on the mission settings button in the top right corner of the MCC console. Adjust the mission settings to your liking.
Next open up the generate mission screen. In this screen you can configure all the mission parameters. Make sure you configure the enemy faction (east) correctly. Press generate mission and your mission will be generated for you.

## Ace3 configuration
Some Ace3 parameters can be configured by the server host by tweaking the parameters in the chose loadout screen. This can only be done before the mission has started. More configuration options in the parameter menu will be added per request via steam.
